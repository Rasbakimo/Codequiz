# Codequiz
for this assignment we had to create a code quiz.
that was the easy part but structuring it is still a challenge.
I started with a list of psudeocode I wrote on paper.
It included the amount of buttons and eventlisteners I thought I should have, all the functions, some arrays, and thought of finding and utilizing new skills and syntax (which I probaly shouldn't do on homework, but I'm trying to get a real world feel.) 
I built my html file, then I made a skeleton for my css. after that I did the outline for my js file. I added some variables,functions, arrays for q/a, event listeners. 
Then I Googled some things and decide to appempt to use radio buttons as my new skill.
